** Conference Paper **
Before submitting the final camera ready copy, remember to:

 1. Manually equalize the lengths of two columns on the last page
 of your paper;

 2. Ensure that any PostScript and/or PDF output post-processing
 uses only Type 1 fonts and that every step in the generation
 process uses the US letter (8.5in X 11in) paper size.
